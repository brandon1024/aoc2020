# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

<img src="advent.png"/>

Here are my solutions for Advent of Code 2020. My goal this year was to solve each problem with unconventional languages or tools. Each directory in this project includes a README.md that states the problem for that day, along with steps for building or running the solution.

Unlike [my attempt in 2018](https://github.com/brandon1024/aoc2018), the solutions are aimed to be crude, hacky and ugly. The more esoteric, the better.

## Solutions:
- Day 1: CMake script
- Day 2: Vimscript
- Day 3: Linux Kernel Character Device Module
